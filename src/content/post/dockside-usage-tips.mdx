## Overview

Dockside is a versatile file shelf app designed to streamline your workflow on macOS. This guide will walk you through its key features, tips for effective usage, and advanced options that enhance your productivity.

### File Dockside vs. Screenshots and Downloads Dockside

Dockside consists of two key sections:

- **File Dockside (Left Side):** This is where you can drag and drop items such as files, folders, apps, images, videos, text snippets, and even screenshots.

- **Screenshots and Downloads Dockside (Right Side):** This section automatically tracks and displays your recent screenshots and downloads, providing easy access to them. **You cannot drag and drop items into this side**—it serves purely as an access point.

### Multiple File Selection

Selecting multiple files in Dockside is simple and flexible. Here are three methods:

1. **Draw a Selection Box:** Click and drag your mouse to create a rectangle around the files you want to select.
2. **Checkbox Selection:** Hover over an icon to reveal a checkbox and select specific files.
3. **Keyboard Shortcut:** Use `⌘ + A` to select all files currently visible in Dockside.

### Keyboard Shortcuts for Efficiency

Dockside supports various keyboard shortcuts to streamline file management, just like Finder:

- **Copy/Paste:** Use `⌘ + C` and `⌘ + V` to copy and paste files.
- **Select All:** Use `⌘ + A` to select all files in Dockside.
- **Move to Bin:** Use the `⌘ + ⌫` to quickly delete files.
  
**Advanced Shortcuts:**

- **Remove When Dragging Out:** Hold the `⌥ — Option` or `⇧ — Shift` key when dragging an item out of Dockside to remove it from Dockside after the operation.
- **Permanently Delete:** To permanently delete a file instead of moving it to the bin, hold the `⌥ — Option` key before right-clicking to see the “Delete Permanently” option.

Dockside is designed to feel as intuitive as Finder, making file management smooth and familiar.

### Handling Non-Existent Files

Sometimes a file listed in Dockside is deleted from the disk. When this happens:

- **Auto Cleanup:** Hover over the file, and Dockside will automatically delete it from the list.
- **Manual Cleanup:** Use the refresh icon to remove any non-existent files or empty quick notes from Dockside.

---

### Recently Added Files

Dockside keeps track of recently added files, making it easy for you to quickly add them back if needed. 

- **Recent Files:** Files that are already in Dockside will appear greyed out in the recently added list.
- **Recent Quick Notes:** Dockside also tracks your recently created quick notes for easy reference.

---

### Customise

Dockside offers several customization options to fit your workflow:
- **Themes and Styles**: Change the appearance of the file shelf to suit your aesthetic preferences.
- **Resize the Shelf**: Adjust the size of Dockside based on your screen real estate and how many files you need quick access to.

### Advanced Options

Dockside offers several advanced settings to fine-tune how it behaves on your Mac:

- **Disable Desktop Features:** If macOS desktop features (like dragging icons) interfere with Dockside, you can disable these interactions from the advanced settings menu.
  
- **Control Drag-and-Drop Behavior:**  
  - Disable “Store only item references” if you prefer to store a copy of the item in Dockside. The location where this item is saved is also something you can specify using Files location, if you want this to be in the iCloud/OneDrive/DropBox - configure this in the settings.
  - Enable or disable the "Remove items after dragging out" option based on your workflow.

These advanced settings give you full control over how Dockside integrates into your desktop experience.

### License Limitations

Dockside allows activation on up to **three devices** at a time. If you need to use Dockside on another machine:

- **Deactivation:** Simply deactivate Dockside on one machine before activating it on another.
- **License Sharing:** License sharing is not permitted, and using the license on more than three devices simultaneously is a violation of the terms of service.

### Data Privacy

Your privacy is our priority. Dockside is designed to operate locally on your machine, and we do not collect any data or usage statistics. Here’s what you need to know:

- **No Data Collection:** Dockside does not track or send any of your data to external servers. All your files, folders, and notes remain entirely on your device.
- **License Activation:** The only time Dockside connects to the internet is during license activation. After activation, the app functions completely offline.

You can trust that Dockside is built with privacy at its core. As an indie developer, I built Dockside with a focus on privacy and utility. I have no need for your data and no interest in collecting it—my goal is to provide a simple, efficient tool for managing your files while keeping your privacy intact.
