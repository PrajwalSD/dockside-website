## Overview

To enable developer to debug an issue, Dockside includes a verbose logging mode to help the developer debug issues efficiently. This mode provides detailed insights into app operations, such as API calls, internal processes, and error traces.

Please note that **no personal data is collected or shared when verbose logging mode is enabled**. Logs are strictly used for debugging purposes and stay within the app's environment.

### How to Enable Advanced Logging

Open the Dockside app and go to Settings and check the **Enable Advanced Logging for Developer** option.

Dockside will then generate verbose logs as a file on disk, which can be shared with the developer for debugging.

When requested by the developer, download the generated log using the **Download log...** button and share the zip file. 

*NOTE: Dockside will automatically disable the advanced logging mode after the zip file has been downloaded, but make sure it's disabled when not needed.*
