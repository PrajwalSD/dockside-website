      Hi, I’m Prajwal, the indie developer behind Hachipoo Apps! 😊 Building apps is a a new found hobby of mine, and I always loved creating tools that help people simplify their workflow. Hachipoo Apps was born out of this passion, with a focus on crafting user-friendly tools like Dockside (my first macOS app!) that emphasize simplicity, privacy, and utility. Thank you for your interest.

        The name “Hachipoo” holds a special place in my heart, inspired by a fond family memory. As a child, a special someone who now loves cricket in our family would adorably call elephants "Hachipoo" and the name has stuck ever since. If you have any questions or feedback, I’d love to hear from you! 💬 Thank you for supporting indie development — it truly means the world to me. 🙏 Feel free to reach out anytime at <a href="mailto:hachipoo.apps@gmail.com" class="text-accent">hachipoo.apps@gmail.com</a>.
