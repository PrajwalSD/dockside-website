    <h1>Dockside Changelog</h1>
    <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.9.56</p>
    <h2>New Features</h2>
    <ul>
		<li><strong>Left/right Dockside placement! (you asked for it)</strong> You can now position Dockside on either side of the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>File stacks.</strong> Dragging multiple files onto the shelf keeps them in a single stack; you can revert to the previous behaviour in settings anyway.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual file ordering (you asked for it)</strong> in the Files shelf—drag and drop to rearrange.</li>
        <li><strong>Shelf colours (you asked for it)</strong> You can now set custom colours for the shelf—a much-requested feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Redesigned preferences and settings panels</strong> for a clearer, more intuitive experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Quick action popover</strong> for bulk actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Notes location.</strong> Choose where Dockside stores the notes it creates.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjustable preview size (you asked for it)</strong>—enlarge or reduce the preview to suit your workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-language support (you asked for it):</strong> Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and German. Localisation files are open source on GitHub for community contributions. Report translation issues to hachipoo.apps@gmail.com.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fixes</h2>
    <ul>
         <li><strong>Cloud sync.</strong> When you add a file to the shelf, Dockside automatically downloads it from the cloud if it isn’t available locally, so follow-up actions work seamlessly.</li>
        <li>Animation and preview performance improvements to reduce glitches.</li>
        <li>Bug fixes and refinements for compatibility with recent macOS Tahoe updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Visual polish and stability refinements throughout. Liquid Glass style is still in the works!</li>
    </ul>
	<h2>Report issues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a major bump to Dockside, with many changes and bug fixes, if you face any issues, please report bugs at the earliest.</li>
    </ul>
