This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy when you use the Dockside app. As an indie developer, I prioritize your privacy and security. Dockside does not collect, store, or share any personal information or usage data. Your files and activities stay entirely on your device, and the app only connects to the internet for a one-time license activation.

## Data Collection

Dockside is designed to operate entirely offline, with no background data collection or usage tracking. Here’s how your data is handled:

- **No Personal Data Collected:** Dockside does not collect any personal data. The app operates locally on your machine, and your files and actions are never sent to external servers or shared with third parties.
- **No Usage Data:** Dockside does not track your usage, such as how often or when you use the app. Everything remains on your local device.
- **Offline Functionality:** Dockside functions without an internet connection, except for a one-time license activation. Once your license is activated, the app will not require or use any internet connectivity.

## Error Reporting

Dockside uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for collecting crash data when the app crashes and only if the user has explicitly given permission via the app settings. Sentry is a popular service used by many popular mac apps like Clop.

The crash data may contain:

- **Device Info:** Such as OS version and Mac type.
- **IP Address:** For diagnostic purposes.

This data is solely used to identify and fix issues to improve the app's stability and performance. No personal data beyond the specified diagnostic information is collected.

  
## License Activation

The only time Dockside connects to the internet is during the initial license activation. This is a one-time event used solely to validate your purchase in Gumroad. After this activation, the app does not use or require internet access.

## Security of Your Data

Since Dockside does not collect or transmit any data, your files and personal information remain completely under your control on your own device. There are no external servers or cloud services involved. Your privacy is fully protected by the app’s local-only functionality.

## No Third-Party Integrations

Dockside does not integrate with third-party services, and no external service providers have access to your data or activity. Your files and personal information stay entirely on your machine.

## Indie Developer Commitment

As the sole developer of Dockside, I build apps with a focus on utility and privacy. I have no interest in your data, and Dockside has been intentionally designed to operate without collecting any. You can use the app with complete confidence that your privacy is respected.

## Children's Privacy

Dockside does not knowingly collect any data, including from children under the age of 13. As there is no data collection, you can be assured that children's privacy is protected by default.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy occasionally, primarily for legal reasons or to clarify new features. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date at the top.
