This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy when you use the Dockside app. As an indie developer, I prioritise your privacy and security. Dockside does not collect, store, share or sell any personal information or usage data. Your files and activities stay entirely on your device, and the app only connects to the internet for a one-time license activation.

## Data Collection

Dockside is designed to operate entirely offline, with no background data collection or usage tracking.

- **No Personal Data Collected:** Dockside does not collect any personal data. The app operates locally on your machine, and your files and actions are never sent to external servers or shared with third parties. We don't care who you are.
- **No Usage Data:** Dockside does not track your usage, such as how often or when you use the app. Everything remains on your local device. We don't care how you use the app as long as it works for you.
- **Offline Functionality:** Dockside functions without an internet connection, except for a one-time license activation. Once your license is activated, the app will not require or use any internet connectivity.

## License Activation

The only time Dockside connects to the internet is during the initial license activation. This is a one-time event used solely to validate your purchase in Gumroad. After this activation, the app does not use or require internet access.

## Error Reporting

Dockside uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for collecting crash data when the app crashes and only if the user has explicitly given permission via the app settings. Sentry is a popular service used by many popular mac apps like Clop.

The crash data may contain:

- **Device Info:** Such as OS version and Mac type.
- **IP Address**

This data is solely used to identify and fix issues to improve the app's stability and performance. No personal data beyond the specified diagnostic information is collected. We are not intersted in any other data

## Security of Your Data

Since Dockside does not collect or transmit any data, your files and personal information remain completely under your control on your own device. There are no external servers or cloud services involved. Your privacy is fully protected by the appâ€™s local-only functionality.

## Third-Party Integrations

Dockside does not integrate with third-party data services without your explicit permission, and no external service providers have access to your personal data or activity. All your files and personal information remain securely on your device. Additionally, apps like Clop, Popclip and Dropshare, which work alongside Dockside when installed locally on your machine, do not access any data without direct user action.Dockside does not integrate with third-party data services without your explicit permission, and no external service providers have access to your personal data or activity. Your files and personal information stay entirely on your machine. Apps like Clop and Dropshare that works with Dockside also don't access data without user action

## Indie Developer Commitment

As the sole developer of Dockside, I build apps with a focus on utility and privacy. I have no interest in your data, and Dockside has been intentionally designed to operate without collecting any. You can use the app with complete confidence that your privacy is respected.

## Children's Privacy

Dockside does not knowingly collect any data, including from children under the age of 13. As there is no data collection, you can be assured that children's privacy is protected by default.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy occasionally, primarily for legal reasons or to clarify new features. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date at the top.
